# 5 min project once agaain
My speedruns comes from 3 yrs back when I learnt bootstrap, I build vscode macros for every style, then deployed it to github pages and call it done, my first property rental site took me about 10 mins, but hey it was my first speed run, and to be fair vs code is slow. I spent too long on that damn carousel.

### Goofy ass 5 min hacks be like
I am severly addicted to coding, they call me no life for a reason. Anyways time to stop procrastinating on my startup stuff after this.

### Story goes:
I realize that instead of click on that small ass copy code button on chatgpt, why not have a big blue button that says download this file
- 1 min to setup repo
- 1 min to load up environment from neovim and pnpm install
- 2 min to do the ai part
- 1 min to deploy
- 1 min to write this read me file, because I might forgot what this is for
- 2 min to post on instagram
- 1 min to rethink my life choices

## So I lied
I actually took 10 min, you've been deceived, hahahah
